File permissions are important, as such they should be set
appropriatly, for example the user Evan, should have the home directory's permissions set
to Evan as Owner and Evan as group (User's also have their own group under the same name)

so for example /home/Michael/* should have the permissions set to Michael:Michael

Now how to run the commands:

For example you want to set everything inside of the /home/Evan directory to be owned and grouped with Evan,
you would need to run the command:

sudo chown Evan:Evan /home/Evan -R

where Evan:Evan, the left Evan is the Owner, while the Evan after the colon is the Group.
/home/Evan is the path to set the owners.
-R is for recursion so everything inside the folder gets set with the same permissions.

(Groups is important for sharing files/folders, remember you can also set group rwx permissions with chmod!)
