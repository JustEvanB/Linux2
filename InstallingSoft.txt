Installing software is pretty straightforward, Debian makes use of a package manager which does
most of the work for you! All we have to do is use the package manager on the command line.

# Updating and Upgrading packages

To update and upgrade all at the same time we can run the command:

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y

this will run both of the commands and -y just means that it will do it all for you without
requiring a user input.

# Installing packages

NOTE: Before installing packages you should always update, and upgrade to ensure that
apt is pulling and downloading the latest version of the application you are downloading

To install an app is just one command, here we will install apt-file so we can use it later in the
documentation:

sudo apt-get install apt-file

Then just follow along with the terminal and it should be installed.

# apt-file

apt-file is used to search for certain commands inside of packages, for example
a common networking tool is ifconfig, however the package isn't called ifconfig it is called something else
which we will find.

Before we run apt-file we will run an update to generate a database of all the files for apt-file to search
through:

apt-file update

Once this is run we can now run:

apt-file search ifconfig

Which will show us a list of every package that contains ifconfig: the one we are looking for is net-tools
